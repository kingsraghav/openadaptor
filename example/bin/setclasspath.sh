# Example script to setup openadaptor classpath.
# Works as follows:
# 1. If OPENDADAPTOR_HOME is set it is used to determine
#    the path for the openadaptor libraries
#    If OPENADAPTOR_HOME is not set, it attempts to guess it.
#    It first tries '.' and then '../../' (assuming it has run
#    from the example/bin directory) and  guesses the lib dir 
#    accordingly.
#
# 2. In then checks that the lib dir exists. If not, it exits.
#
# 3. Next it checks to see if the CLASSPATH is already set
#    and contains the libraries. If so, it exits.
#
# 4. It creates or appends the CLASSPATH with the openadaptor
#    libraries.
# Use existing OPENADAPTOR_HOME if it is already set
#
