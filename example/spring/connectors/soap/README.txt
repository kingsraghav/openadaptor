This folder contains similar Web service examples based on the XFire and the newer CXF framework. 
As the development of the XFire framework stopped and moved to its successor CXF, the XFire framework
will be gradually phased out from Openadaptor. 
Users new to OA Web service connectors are advised to consider CXF based connectors only.

CXF requires JVM 1.5+.
