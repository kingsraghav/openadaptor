<h1>Build basics</h1>

<p>The build is based on <a href="https://gradle.org">Gradle</a> and replaces the prior existing Apache Ant build.</p>
<p>Currently the build requires a JDK 6 (including correct set JAVA_HOME environemtn variable) to run. A Gradle installation is not required.
The projects root directory contains a gradlew/gradlew.bat shell script for unix/windows, which automatically provides the correct version
of Gradle on the build machine. The build always needs to be started via the gradlew commands.</p>

<p>Additionally the build needs to have <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">Graphviz</a> (working with 2.36) installed on the build machine.
The default installation directories can be seen in <code>openadaptor/example/tools/docs.properties</code>. If your installation differs,
the executable could be passed in with as command line option: <code>-Pgraphviz.dot=E:\your\path\to\graphviz\bin\dot.exe</code></p>

<p>In cases where external web sites like www.openadaptor.org are not accessible, it is possible to do a local release build. Use the command line
option <code>-DlocalBuild</code> then.</p>

<h1>The build file</h1>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><code><b>build.gradle</b></code></td>
    <td>Manages all build relevant tasks. This includes compiling everything in the work area, runing junit tests and verification of 
      targets for development as well as releases.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h1>The default tasks</h1>

<p>You can use <code>gradlew tasks --all</code> to see the important tasks of the respective files but all of these 
  have sensible default targets. The following commands are normally sufficient.</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><div class="shell"><pre>gradlew clean build</pre></div></td>
    <td>Performs a clean compile and runs all the tests and packages the distribution from local sources.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><div class="shell"><pre>gradlew clean build -Dtag=x.y.z</pre></div></td>
    <td>Performs a clean release build from local sources.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The compilation and packaging is parameterised by an property called "tag". This affects
the version number that is embedded in the openadpator.jar file, the javadocs, the directory
structure and name of the distribution zip. If the tag property is not specified then is
gets set to "trunk", the resultant zip file will be called <code>openadaptor-trunk-bin.zip</code>, 
 the root directory structure will be <code>openadaptor-untagged</code> and the release will echo the
  following log line</p>

<div class="shell"><pre>
  Builds tag is trunk
</pre></div>

<p>This reflects the fact that the distribution is based on your local workarea and is of indeterminate
version.</p>
  
<h1>Building releases</h1>

<p>In contrast to prior versions of the Ant build, the current Gradle build does not perform release builds directly from SVN tags. This will
be reintroduced in the future. In the meantime this is covered by the following process.</p>

<p>If you want to create a release you should do the following steps:<p>
<ul>
  <li>Check out the state of the working directory you want to create the release for. Take care that your local working directory is 
    identical with the remote source repository.</li>
  <li>Update the <code>build.gradle</code> with the version of the release in top line. E.g. <code>version = 'x.y.z'</code>. This variable exists 
  need to be changed in the build files of openadaptor and dealbus.</li>
  <li>Check in the changed <code>build.gradle</code> into the source repository and create a svn tag for the version.</li>
  <li>Run the release build by calling <code>gradlew clean build -Dtag=x.y.z</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The resulting output will be <code>openadaptor-x.y.z-bin.zip</code>.</p>
