<h1>The build files</h1>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><code><b>build.xml</b></code></td>
    <td>Compiles everything in the work area, runs junit tests and verification targets.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code><b>release.xml</b></code></td>
    <td>Checks out a clean work area from the revision control system and then invokes build.xml and package.xml.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code><b>patch.xml</b></code></td>
    <td>Checks out a clean work area from the revision control system and then invokes build.xml and package.xml.
        Then checks out explicit patches to the release, compiles these against the release, reruns the
        tests against the patched classpath and generates a patch.jar for distribution.</td>
  </tr>
</table>     

<h1>The default targets</h1>

<p>You can use <code>ant -p</code> to see the important targets of the respective files but all of these 
  have sensible default targets. The following commands are normally sufficient.</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><div class="shell"><pre>ant [-f build.xml]</pre></div></td>
    <td>Performs a clean compile and runs all the tests.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><div class="shell"><pre>ant -f release.xml</pre></div></td>
    <td>"Checks out" a new work area from subversion (in a temp directory called checkout), compiles ,tests and packages it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><div class="shell"><pre>ant -f patch.xml -Dtag=x.y.z</pre></div></td>
    <td>"Checks out" a new work area from subversion for a tagged release (in a temp directory called checkout), compiles ,tests and packages it.
    "Checks out" explicit patches based on pacthes/x.y.z.xml, compiles these against the compiled tagged release, reruns test and "spits ou" a patch.jar file</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>A developer might normally only invoke <code>build.xml</code>. Invoking <code>release</code>.xml in the local workarea is really only 
applicable for testing the release process. 

See the next section for how to build a release for general use.</p> 

<p>The compilation and packaging is parameterised by an ant property called "tag". This affects
the version number that is embedded in the openadpator.jar file, the javadocs, the directory
structure and name of the distribution zip. If the tag property is not specified then is
gets set to "trunk", the resultant zip file will be called <code>openadaptor-trunk-bin.zip</code>, 
 the root directory structure will be <code>openadaptor-untagged</code> and the release will echo the
  following log line</p>

<div class="shell"><pre>
  INFO  [main] openadaptor.build.tag = untagged
</pre></div>

<p>This reflects the fact that the distribution is based on your local workarea and is of indeterminate
version.</p>
  
<h1>Building releases</h1>

<p>If you want to create a release you should use <code>release.xml</code>, this will checkout a workarea from 
subversion and invoke <code>build.xml</code> and <code>package.xml</code>. As part of the checkout 
it generates  a file called <code>checkout.properties</code> in the checkout area. This will be 
automatically sourced when <code>build.xml</code> and <code>package.xml</code> are invoked in the 
workarea. Basically it sets the value for the <code>tag</code> property.</p> 
  
<p>If you invoke release.xml like this...</p>

<div class="shell"><pre>
  ant -f release.xml
</pre></div>
  
<p>then the workarea will be based on the trunk and hence the resulting output will be 
  <code>openadaptor-trunk-bin.zip</code> this is typically used to provide daily build.</p>

<p>Versioned releases relate to specific subversion tags. If you invoke release.xml like this..</p>

<div class="shell"><pre>
  ant -f release.xml -Dtag=3.2.1
</pre></div>
  
<p>then the workarea will be based on that tag and hence the resulting output will be 
  <code>openadaptor-3.2.1-bin.zip</code>
</p>.
  
<h1>Building patches</h1>

 <p>For minor fixes and enhancements we typically deliver a patch jar. patch.xml provides a way of
 building patch jars. To avoid having to branch releases patch definitions are maintained in patch files,
 these are checked into the trunk under the patch directory. By convention the patch definition files
 are named after the release that they relate to. The patch definition files are actually ant build files,
 the contents specify the files and revisions that form the patch. There is a template in the patches directory
 which should serve as the basis for any patch.</p>
  
<p>
Building a patch consists of the following steps  
</p>
<ol>
  <li>checking out the release the patch relates to</li>
  <li>building and packaging that release</li>
  <li>checking out the constitients of the patch (by invoking the patch definition file)</li>
  <li>compiling the patch constituents (against the packaged release)</li>
  <li>augmenting the .openadaptor.properties with the patch info</li>
  <li>running any test cases contained in the patch (with the patched classpath)</li>
  <li>rerunning the release tests (with the patched classpath)</li>
  <li>jar-ing the compiled patch and .openadaptor.properties and patch definition file</li>
</ol>
  
<p>All of this is automated by the default target of patch.xml, this must be invoked with the tag
property defined, e.g.</p>
  
<div class="shell"><pre>
  ant -f patch.xml -Dtag=3.2.1
</pre></div>

<p>If everything is sucessful, this will generate patch.jar. Since this mechanism has been put in place
both setclasspath.sh and setclasspath.bat include patch.jar. The ClasspathBootstrapper used by bootstrap.jar
will ensure that patch.jar is at the head of the classpath. You should notice that when a patch is picked
up this is apparent in the log output </p>  

<div class="shell"><pre>
INFO  [main] openadaptor.build.tag = 3.2.1
INFO  [main] openadaptor.build.patch = 522 compiled by perryj on 20070314:1627
INFO  [main] openadaptor.build.compiler = 1.4
INFO  [main] openadaptor.build.timestamp = 20070314:1458
</pre></div>

<p>The patch number is the subversion revision of the patch definition file. It is also worth knowing
that the patch definition file is also bundled into the patch.jar.</p>
