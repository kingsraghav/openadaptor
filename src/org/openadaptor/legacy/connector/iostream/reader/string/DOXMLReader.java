 * Utility class for setting up a DOXMLReader.
 * <BR>
 * This is a convenience subclass of RegexMultiLineReader which
 * is solely for reading legacy DOXML.
 * Legacy openadaptor (1.7.2.2) requires a very strict format
 * for incoming doxml.
 * (legacy org.openadaptor.util.sax.XMLUtils provides the mechanism)
 * <pre><code>
 *   public static final String XML_HEADER_START = "&lt;?xml version='1.0' encoding='";
 *   public static final String XML_HEADER_END = "'?&gt";
 * </code></pre>
 * The header must start with exactly XML_HEADER_START, and end with XML_HEADER_END.
