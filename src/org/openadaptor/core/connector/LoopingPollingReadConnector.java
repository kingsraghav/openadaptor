/**
 * A polling read connector that calls to underlying read connector at fixed time 
 * intervals. When this connector polls it calls the following on the IReadConnector it is
 * wrapping...
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link IReadConnector#connect()}
 * <li>{@link IReadConnector#next(long)}, until {@link IReadConnector#isDry()}
 * returns true
 * <li>{@link IReadConnector#disconnect()}
 * </ul>
 * 
 * Out of the box, without setting any polling intervals the adaptor will perform 
 * a single poll and then exit</li>.
 *
 * By setting the <code>pollInterval</code> you will cause it to repeatedly poll, with the
 * specified poll interval between poll attempts.
 *
 * By setting the <code>pollInterval</code> and the <code>pollBackOff</code> you will cause it
 * to repeatedly poll (with the specified poll interval between attempts) until an empty set of
 * results is received when it will back off (for the specified poll back off) before continuing
 * the normal polling.  This is useful if you are polling an event source and wish to pick up data
 * when it is present, and then go to sleep for a bit when no data is present.
