/**
 * An abstract implementation of {@link IPollingReadConnector}. 
 * <br>
 * Based on the legacy <code>PollingReadConnector</code>.
 * When this connector polls, and the <code>reconnectDelegateBetweenPolls</code> flag is true,
 * it calls the following on the IReadConnector it is
 * wrapping...
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link IReadConnector#connect()}
 * <li>{@link IReadConnector#next(long)}, until {@link IReadConnector#isDry()}
 * returns true
 * <li>{@link IReadConnector#disconnect()}
 * </ul>
 * 
 * If the <code>reconnectDelegateBetweenPolls</code> flag is false, the following is called on 
 * the underlying IReadConnector:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link IReadConnector#next(long)}, until {@link IReadConnector#isDry()}
 * returns true
 * </ul>
 * 
 * If the delate reader is {@link ITransactional} the polling reader will also be involved 
 * in a transaction. For details see SC90.
