 * returns true
 * <li>{@link IReadConnector#disconnect()}

   * patterns that specify the following:
   * 
   * <pre>
   *       Minute (0-59)
   *       Hour (0-23)
   *       Day of the month (1-31)
   *       Month of the year (1-12)
   *       Day of the week (0-6 with 0=Sunday)
   * </pre>
   * 
   * Each of these patterns can be either an asterisk (meaning all valid
   * values), an element or a list of elements separated by commas. An element
   * must be either a number or two numbers separated by a hyphen (meaning an
   * inclusive range). The specification of days can be made by two fields (day
   * of the month and day of the week). If month, day of month and day of week
   * are all asterisks, every day will be matched. If either the month or day of
   * month is specified as an element or list, but the day of week is an
   * asterisk, the month and day of month fields will specify the days that
   * match. If both month and day of month are specified as asterisk, but day of
   * week is an element or list, then only the specified days of the week will
   * match. Finally, if either the month or day of month is specified as an
   * element or list, and the day of week is also specified as an element or
   * list, then any day matching either the month and day of month or the day of
   * week, will be matched. <p/>
   * 
   * The sixth field in a crontab entry is traditionally a string that will be
   * executed by the shell at the specified times. In our case it must be a "?"
   * character. <p/>
