Fundamental interfaces of openadaptor and the classes that they reference.

<p> The
<b>IMessageProcessor</b> interface represents something that can process a Message and return a Response,
classes such as Adaptor, Node, Router and Pipeline implement this interface. The implementations
of IMessageProcessor and other core interfaces to do with transaction management, exception
processing and lifecycle management are all under this package.</p>

<p>The <b>IReadConnector</b>
represents something that connect to an external resource and read / receive data, it can be thought
of as the thing that initiates the processing.</p>
<p>The <b>IWriteConnector</b> interface represents something that can connect to an external resource and write / deliver
data, it can be thought of as the thing that completes the processing.</p>
<p>The <b>IDataProcessor</b> represents something that modifies or discards data, it can be thought of as an
intermediate step in the processing.</p> 

<p>The implementations of these interfaces are mainly found in the following packages.</p>
<li><a href="auxil/package.html">org.openadaptor.auxil</a></li>
<li><a href="thirdparty/package.html">org.openadaptor.thirdparty</a></li>
