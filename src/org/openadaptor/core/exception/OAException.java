/**
 * Base class extended by all openadaptor unchecked exceptions.
 *
 * <p>RuntimeExceptions raised by openadaptor components should always be an
 * instance of this class or it's subclasses. This allows the Exception
 * Management System to easily distinguish openadaptor specific exceptions.</p>
 *
 * <p>As this extends RuntimeException this exception can be used to wrap
 * other exceptions. It is strongly reccomended that all third party exceptions
 * raised by Connectors or DataProcessors are wrapped by the appropriate
 * OAException subclass. This makes it much easier to configure openadaptor's
 * exception management correctly.</p>
 *
 * <p>OAException extends RuntimeException to add the ability to record the
 * IComponent that raised the exception. This is an optional feature. There
 * is no need to supply this if the exception is not being raised by an
 * IComponent implementation.</p>
