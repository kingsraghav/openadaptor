 * pipeline, or the adaptor itself.
 * 
 * This interface extends {@link ISimpleComponentMetrics} with more detailed 
 * methods that return mostly numeric data that can be further processed 
 * and computed to achieve things like generating adaptor's reports,
 * storing audit data, generating charts and graphs from an adaptor's
 * run.
 * 
 * Extends {@link ILifecycleListener} to be able to automatically 
 * record starts and stops of those monitored components that are
 * {@link ILifecycleComponent}s.
