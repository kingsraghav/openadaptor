/**
 * Enrichment processors in Openadaptor implement a pattern often called Content Enricher.
 * Content Enricher uses information inside the incoming message to retrieve data from
 * an external source. After it retrieves the required data from the resource, it 
 * appends data to the message. The original information from the incoming message
 * may be carried over into the resulting message or may no longer be needed, depending
 * on the needs of the receiving component. 
 * 
 * Enrichment processors are often used to references contained in a message. In order
 * to keep messages small and easy to manage, simple references are often passed as an
 * adaptor message rather than complete objects with all data elements. These references
 * usually take the form of keys or unique IDs. When the message needs to be processed
 * by an adaptor, the required data items need to be retrieved based on object references
 * included in the original message. 
 * 
 * Interface that represents an enrichment processor. An enrichment processor 
 * has access to a read connector that will query an external resource for 
 * data that enrichment processor will then use to enrich its input data.
