 * This allows String objects to be represented as ISimpleRecords. This may be useful if, say an entire record is to be
 * used in a processor (as opposed to some of it's attributes).
 * <p>
 * For example, when reading Delimited String records, it might first be necessary to filter out records which are
 * comments, and don't have the delimited string format. It has a strict flag (true by default) which mandates that
 * supplied objects must be Strings. If false, Any object may be represented.
