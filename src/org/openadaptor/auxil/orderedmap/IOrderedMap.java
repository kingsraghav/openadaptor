/**
 * This extends the <code>Map</code> interface to add <code>List</code>-like behaviour.
 * <p>
 * IOrderedMaps are primarily intended to provide access to tabular data.
 * <p>
 * Unfortunately it's not possible to extend both <code>Map</code> and <code>List</code> interfaces as both specify
 * remove() methods with conflicting signatures.
 * <p>
 * In essence, an IOrderedMap is one where in addition to providing Map functionality, the order of the data in the map
 * is also managed.
 * <p>
 * For example, when entries are added via the put(key,value) method, the order in which they are added is preserved.
 * Also, if an entry is added without a key, then one is auto-generated for it.
 * <p>
 * Note also that the current implementation does not attempt to give complete coverage of the List interface, only
 * those methods which we currently see as necessary. This may well change as OA3 matures.
