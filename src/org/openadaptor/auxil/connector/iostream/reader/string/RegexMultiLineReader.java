/**
 * Line based reader which uses regular expressions to define record boundaries.
 * A typical use case might be where the reader is presented with multiple XML documents in a single 
 * stream/file which need to be split into records for processing.<br/>
 * This may be achieved by
 *  <ul>
 *  <li>defining a startLineRegex similar to "^\s*&lt;\?xml.*$"</li>
 *  <li>omitting an endLineRegex</li>
 *  <li>setting includeRecordDelimiters to <code>true</code></li>
 * </ul>
 * Notes:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Users should configure a starting regular expression ({@link #setStartLineRegex startLineRegex}) to identify the
 * beginning of a record.</li>
 * <li>Optionally they may configure a second expression ({@link #setEndLineRegex endLineRegex}) to identify the end of a record</li>
 * <li>If the end expression is not defined, a record is assumed to end before the next
 * matching starting expression, or end of file.</li>
 * <li>lines between an ending expression and the next start expression are discarded.</li>
 * <li>The delimiting expressions themselves may be included or excluded from the record by setting 
 *     {@link #setIncludeRecordDelimiters includeRecordDelimiters} as desired.
 * <li>Note that if an end expression is omitted, the reader must read-ahead to find the next starting line. The size
 *     of the read-ahead buffer may be specified using {@link #setReadAheadLimit readAheadLimit}. By default
 *     this is set to {@link #DEFAULT_READ_AHEAD_LIMIT}. It has no effect if the end expression is set.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 *  SC106 - Modified to make ending expression optional, allowing records to be delimited by starting regex alone
 * @author Eddy Higgins
 * @see IDataReader
