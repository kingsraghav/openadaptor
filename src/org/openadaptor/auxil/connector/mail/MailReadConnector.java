/**
 * Read connector that polls for mail messages. Essentially, we poll the named
 * folder for "new" messages. The body of the mail message is treated as the input to
 * the pipeline. Everything else is discarded (e.g Subject, to/from fields, attachments,
 * etc). Once the message is processed it can be marked read, moved or deleted so that
 * it will not be processed again.
 * <p />
 *
 * Supports both POP3 and IMAP protocols.
 * <p />
 *
 * Note: the implementation of protocol is down to the vendors of the mail server
 * and seem to vary quite a bit. This is particularly relevant to the message flags.
 * We have tested this component using MS-Exchange (IMAP) and also Java Email Server
 * (POP3).
 * <p />
 *
 * Besides deleting messages, the POP protocol does not support setting flags on messages.
 * So this means that there is no point marking messages as read after they are processed.
 * A warning will be issued if this is attempted.
 * <p />
 *
 * Given the flexibility of the properties it is very easy to get the adaptor to poll
 * a single message continuously. This is generally a bad thing and the adaptor will
 * warn you about it - but won't stop you from doing it. The following table tries to
 * highlight the effects:
 * <p />
 *
 * <pre>
 *     ProcessReadMessages     MarkRead        Effects
 *             true              true          1. All messages are to be processed
 *                                                regardless of read state so the first
 *                                                one will be continuously processed.
 *                                             2. Read messages are left read.
 *                                             3. Unread messages are marked read.
 *                                             Warning issued
 *
 *             true              false         1. All messages are to be processed
 *                                                regardless of read state so the first
 *                                                one will be continuously processed.

 *                                             3. Unread messages are left unread.
 *                                             Warning issued
 *
 *             false*            true*         1. Only unread messages are processed.
 *                                                As the MarkRead property is true, each
 *                                                unread message is processed in order.
 *                                             2. Read messages are left read.
 *                                             3. Unread messages are marked read.
 *
 *             false             false         1. Only unread messages are processed but
 *                                                they are not marked as read so the first
 *                                                unread message will be continuously
 *                                                processed.
 *                                             2. Read messages are left read.
 *                                             3. Unread messages are left unread.
 *                                             Warning issued
 *
 *      * default values
 *
 *      Note: This only applies when the <i>DeleteWhenRead</i> property is set to false.
 * </pre>
 *
 * There is one vulnerability to this connector and that is where deleted messages are
 * not expunged from the mailbox until the folder is closed. We open/close the folder
 * on each poll but there is always a chance that the close fails and thus any processed
 * messages marked for deletion will be put into a limbo state. If you start seeing
 * "Error closing inbox" messages in the logs then you will need to manually check the
 * folder and potentially clear out these messages.
 * <p />
 *
 * You can also run into trouble if you delete messages from the inbox while the adaptor
 * is running. Because we need to set flags on the message after we have processed it
 * there is a window of opportunity that the message will "disappear" after the data is
 * read and the flags are set. In this case, the adaptor will log a message and continue
 * on to the next message ignoring the deleted one. In this way we achieve a kind of a
 * transactional process.
