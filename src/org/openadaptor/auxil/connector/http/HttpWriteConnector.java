/**
 * Makes a HTTP POST call to the specified URL.
 * 
 * The POST method is used to request that the destination server accept the data enclosed in the request. 
 * POST is designed to allow a uniform method to cover a variety of functions such as appending to a database, 
 * providing data to a data-handling process or posting to a message board.
 * It is generally expected that a POST request will have some side effect on the server such as writing 
 * to a database.
 * 
 * The writer allows for optional setting of an HTTP proxy.
