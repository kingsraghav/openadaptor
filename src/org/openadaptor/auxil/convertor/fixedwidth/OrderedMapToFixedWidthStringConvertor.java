/**
 * Converts an ordered map to a fixed width string. <p/>
 * 
 * To do this you must supply the widths of the fields that you wish to be outputted. Additionally you may supply the
 * field names which will be used to select the corresponding values from the map. <p/>
 * 
 * If you supply the names then they will be used as keys to "search" for the corresponding map values. Note, that you
 * do not have to supply names for all the map elements and can output some or all of them. Additionally, if you the map
 * does not contain the field name then a "blank" field will be generated. A side effect of this is that you can
 * completely change the order that fields are output. <p/>
 * 
 * If you supply just the widths then each element in the map will the output in turn. You do not have any choice over
 * the order. If you are using just the field widths then there are some fairly draconian requirements that are imposed -
 * chief amongst thenm is the fact that the number of widths defiend must match the number of elements in the map.
 * Further explaination of this is provided below. <p/>
 * 
 * In both cases, the string output will be trimmed/padded to the appropriate width.
