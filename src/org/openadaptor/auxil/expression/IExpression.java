/**
 * Common interface for openadaptor Expressions.
 * <p>
 * In general, openadaptor expressions look like normal algebraic expressions, the difference being that the variables
 * used within the expressions are taken as placeholders for attribute values within a supplied record. Expressions
 * operate on ISimpleRecord objects, which in turn provide implementation neutral access to underlying record attributes
 * for use within expressions.
 * <p>
 * In addition, expression variables may have type conversion applied before they are used in expressions. This is
 * achieved by providing an attribute type map, which provides hints as to how an attribute from a record should be
 * treated if it being referenced in the expression
 * 
 * For examples of expressions in use, see the examples included with openadaptor
 * 
 * @author Eddy Higgins
 * @deprecated ScriptProcessor or ScriptFilterProcessor may be used in place of Expressions
